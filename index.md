I am a fourth year PhD candidate in Economics at University of California at Irvine with specializations in Econometrics and Banking. My objective is to develop and utilize innovative empirical methods to provide original insights to research questions in Banking. In my current research, I have studied bank failures during the Savings and Loans crisis and their resolution by the FDIC. I have developed an efficient estimation algorithm for a Bayesian latent class model and uncovered heterogeneity in how systemic and idiosyncratic failures were addressed during the period 1984-1992. I am currently examining the moral hazard effects of the FDICâ€™s financial assistance to failed banks and thrifts on depository institutions that were at the most risk of failure using Bayesian Nonparametric methods.

I have received my undergraduate degree in Economics, Mathematics and Statistics from  <a href="http://bangaloreuniversity.ac.in//" target="_blank">Bangalore University</a> where I was awarded the Gold Medal in Mathematics. I hold a Masters degree in Economics from <a href="http://www.igidr.ac.in//" target="_blank">Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research</a> (established by the Reserve Bank of India) and was awarded the RBI Governor's Gold Medal. 

I have worked as a quantitative risk modeler and team manager in financial services prior to commencing my doctoral studies at UC Irvine. I use my insights from studying bank portfolios and experience in working with bank and industry-level datasets to model credit and operational risk over the period spanning the Great Recession to inform my research.

__Research Interests__: Banking crises, Bayesian Nonparametrics, Latent class models, MCMC estimation

### Working Papers

- Bayesian Latent Class Modeling with Ordinal Response Data

Bayesian methods to estimate latent class models have been developed and implemented in contexts involving continuous and binary outcome data but have not yet been adapted to model ordinal responses. I address this open area of research and develop an efficient collapsed Gibbs sampler to estimate such models in univariate and multivariate settings. The paper discusses issues pertaining to model identification and prior sensitivity and provides applications from labor and banking. 

- Heterogeneity in the Resolution of Bank Failures: A
Latent Class Approach

This paper investigates the resolution of failed banks by the FDIC during 1984-1992 and finds that bank failures that were accompanied by regional economic distress had a higher median probability of receiving financial assistance from the FDIC compared to those that failed in a relatively more favorable economic climate. This article also provides evidence in favor of the importance of the political support of elected representatives in securing relatively less severe forms of resolution for banks that failed in economically distressed regions. A novel Bayesian procedure to estimate latent class models with ordinal responses is utilized to detect unobserved heterogeneity in bank resolution.
