I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of California at Irvine with specializations in Econometrics and Banking. I am currently on the job market and will be at the ASSA meetings at Atlanta between January 4-6, 2019.

In my job market paper, I have studied bank failures during the 1980's and their resolution by the FDIC. I have developed an efficient estimation algorithm for a Bayesian latent class model and uncovered heterogeneity in how failures amidst high and low regional distress were addressed during the period 1984-1992. This paper provides insights into the FDIC's consideration of indirect economic costs of bank closures in addition to assessing direct costs to the insurance fund. This study also tests theories of optimal bailouts and resolutions at the bank-level.  

I was a dissertation intern at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during June-September 2018 and a recipient of the Graduate Dean's Dissertation Fellowship in UCI over Summer and Fall 2018. I have completed my undergraduate degree in Economics, Mathematics and Statistics from  <a href="http://bangaloreuniversity.ac.in//" target="_blank">Bangalore University</a> where I was awarded the Gold Medal in Mathematics. I hold a Masters degree in Economics from <a href="http://www.igidr.ac.in//" target="_blank">Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research</a> (established by the Reserve Bank of India) and was awarded the RBI Governor's Gold Medal. 

I have worked as a quantitative risk modeler and team manager in financial services prior to commencing my doctoral studies at UC Irvine. I use my insights from evaluating bank portfolios and experience in developing statistical models to manage credit and operational risk over the period spanning the Great Recession to inform my research.

### Working Papers

<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nxJe7RI9TxIAs7UxJjmDuNqgMk2Pto1u" target="_blank">Uncovering Heterogeneity in the Resolution of Bank Failures</a>

This article studies the FDIC's problem of resolving failed banks over the period 1984-1992 as an amalgam of two distinct decision rules. The results show that bank failures that were accompanied by regional economic distress were administered by a decision
rule that favored less severe resolution methods such as the provision of financial assistance. This decision rule showed greater sensitivity to bank fundamentals than the rule applied to banks that failed in normal economic conditions. These results are based
on an efficient collapsed Gibbs sampler developed in this paper to estimate Bayesian latent class models to detect unobserved heterogeneity in bank resolution.

“Suspension of Payments and their Consequences” with Christoffer Koch, Qian Chen and Gary Richardson

Governors suspended payments by healthy financial institutions in their states four times in the last forty years. Suspensions in Nebraska (1983), Ohio (1985), and Maryland (1985), which occurred during economic expansions, had little measurable impact at the state-level. The suspension in Rhode Island (1991), which occurred during a recession, lengthened and deepened the contraction relative to states with comparable pre-suspension patterns of economic activity. We document the suspension’s impact on macroeconomics aggregates, such as unemployment, payrolls, per capita incomes, business formation, bankruptcies, and mortgage defaults, using methods of synthetic control. Our estimates help us to address two policy questions. Were the costs of direct federal and state expenditures to prevent suspension of payments from the Great Depression until today worth the benefits? Was the cost of federal interventions to prevent suspensions of payments by commercial banks following the collapse of Lehman brothers in September 2008 worth the likely benefits? In both cases, our answer is yes.

"Bayesian Latent Class Modeling with Ordinal Response Data"

Bayesian methods to estimate latent class models have been developed and implemented in contexts involving continuous and binary outcome data but have not yet been adapted to model ordinal responses. I address this open area of research and develop an efficient collapsed Gibbs sampler to estimate such models in univariate and multivariate settings. The paper discusses issues pertaining to model identification and prior sensitivity and provides applications from education and banking.
