I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of California at Irvine with specializations in Econometrics and Banking. I am currently on the job market and will be at the ASSA meetings at Atlanta between January 4-6, 2019.

In my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nxJe7RI9TxIAs7UxJjmDuNqgMk2Pto1u" target="_blank">job market paper</a> , I have studied how the FDIC and FSLIC resolved failed banks and Savings and Loans institutions respectively during the crisis the two industries experienced over the 1980's. This paper develops an efficient Bayesian algorithm to estimate latent class models with ordinal outcomes to uncover the different decision rules used by each regulator in distressed and normal economic conditions. The comparison of resolution strategies of the two agencies reveals lessons that are applicable to regulators for future bank resolutions.     

I was a dissertation intern at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during June-September 2018 and a recipient of the Graduate Dean's Dissertation Fellowship in UCI over Summer and Fall 2018. 

I have worked as a quantitative risk modeler and team manager in financial services prior to commencing my doctoral studies at UC Irvine. My research is informed by my insights from evaluating bank portfolios and experience in developing statistical models to manage credit and operational risk over the period spanning the Great Recession.

__Research Interests__: Econometrics, Financial Economics, Computational Statistics and Macroeconomics

How should bank regulators resolve troubled banks? I address this question by drawing from the experiences of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Savings and Loans Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) in resolving failures of banks and Savings and Loans (S\&L) institutions respectively during the crisis of the 1980's in the two industries. I find that the FDIC adopted different decision rules for banks that failed in economically distressed regions as opposed to those that failed in relatively benign regional economic conditions. The former were seven times more likely to receive assistance and eight times less likely to be liquidated compared to the latter. The FSLIC did not distinguish across institutions based on the extent of economic distress in their region of operation and provided assistance to failed institutions with a higher probability than the FDIC. Since the FDIC withstood the banking crisis whereas the FSLIC underwent bankruptcy at significant cost to the taxpayer, the resolution strategy of the former provides guiding principles for other regulators in handling bank failures. This paper estimates the different decision rules used by each regulator in distressed and normal economic conditions by developing an efficient Bayesian algorithm to estimate latent class models with ordinal outcomes.  This estimation approach fully explores the parameter space and therefore overcomes local identifiability issues associated with likelihood-based algorithms. This algorithm allows straightforward inference on quantities of interest such as covariate effects and offers a coherent framework for model comparison. 

**Suspension of Payments and their Consequences** with Christoffer Koch, Qian Chen and Gary Richardson

Governors suspended payments by healthy financial institutions in their states four times in the last forty years. Suspensions in Nebraska (1983), Ohio (1985), and Maryland (1985), which occurred during economic expansions, had little measurable impact at the state-level. The suspension in Rhode Island (1991), which occurred during a recession, lengthened and deepened the contraction relative to states with comparable pre-suspension patterns of economic activity. We document the suspensionâ€™s impact on macroeconomics aggregates, such as unemployment, payrolls, per capita incomes, business formation, bankruptcies, and mortgage defaults, using methods of synthetic control. Our estimates help us to address two policy questions. Were the costs of direct federal and state expenditures to prevent suspension of payments from the Great Depression until today worth the benefits? Was the cost of federal interventions to prevent suspensions of payments by commercial banks following the collapse of Lehman brothers in September 2008 worth the likely benefits? In both cases, our answer is yes.

**Bayesian Latent Class Modeling with Ordinal Response Data**

Bayesian methods to estimate latent class models have been developed and implemented in contexts involving continuous and binary outcome data but have not yet been adapted to model ordinal responses. I address this open area of research and develop an efficient collapsed Gibbs sampler to estimate such models in univariate and multivariate settings. The paper discusses issues pertaining to model identification and prior sensitivity and provides applications from education and banking.
