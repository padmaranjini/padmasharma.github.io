I am a fourth year PhD candidate in Economics at University of California at Irvine with specializations in Econometrics and Banking. In my current research, I study bank failures during the Savings and Loans crisis and their resolution by the FDIC using a novel Bayesian latent class model and uncover heterogeneity in how systemic and idiosyncratic failures were addressed.

I have received my undergraduate degree in Economics, Mathematics and Statistics from Bangalore University where I was awarded the Gold Medal in Mathematics. I hold a Masters degree in Economics from Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research (established by the Reserve Bank of India) and was awarded the RBI Governor's Gold Medal. 

I have worked as a quantitative modeler and team manager in financial services in India, the UK, Chile and  the US prior to commencing my doctoral studies at UC Irvine. I developed statistical models to calculate banking regulatory capital over the period spanning the Great Recession and use my experiences from the crisis to inform my research.

__Research Interests__: Banking crises, Bayesian Nonparametrics, Latent class models, MCMC estimation

### Working Papers
__Theory and Methods__

- Bayesian Latent Class Modeling with Ordinal Response Data

Bayesian methods to estimate latent class models have been developed and implemented in contexts involving continuous 
and binary outcome data but have not yet been adapted to model ordinal responses. I address this open area of research 
and develop an efficient collapsed Gibbs sampler to estimate such models in univariate and multivariate settings. 
I discuss issues pertaining to identification, prior sensitivity and identify constraints on the data that ensure that the posterior 
means are centered around the true parameter values. 

- Heterogeneity in the Resolution of Bank Failures: A
Latent Class Approach

This paper investigates the resolution of failed banks by the FDIC and uncovers a dichotomy in the manner 
in which cases were administered when local economic conditions were normal against when they were distressed.
I use a latent class model for ordinal outcomes to frame the FDIC's decision problem that involved a trade-off between
two primary objectives of maintaining public confidence in the stability of the banking system and encouraging market discipline against risk-taking.
Banks that failed subsequent to unfavorable local economic conditions had a higher median probability of receiving 
financial assistance from the FDIC compared to those that failed in a relatively more favorable economic climate. 
The response of the FDIC to bank-level attributes is found to be substantially stronger in the former category of 
banks relative to the latter group. While these findings corroborate the conclusions of Acharya and Yorulmazer (2007b) 
regarding the onset of a too-many-to-fail effect, they also bring to light enhanced decision-making processes at the 
FDIC in the resolution of failed banks during times of industry-wide distress. I develop a novel Bayesian procedure to 
estimate latent class models with ordinal responses to detect unobserved heterogeneity in bank resolution. 
I analyze all failures that occurred during 1984-1992 among US banks insured by the FDIC as the regulatory landscape 
and the spate of regional bank crises during this period created conditions in which bank failures that were 
crisis-driven and idiosyncratic occurred contemporaneously.
