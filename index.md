I am a third year PhD candidate in [Statistics](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/StatGroup/) co-advised by Prof. [Gourab Mukherjee](https://gmukherjee.github.io/) and Prof. [Wenguang Sun](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~wenguans/) in the department of [Data Sciences and Operations](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations) at [USC Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/). I received my MS degree in Statistics from the [Indian Statistical Institute](http://www.isical.ac.in/) and a BS degree in Statistics from [St. Xavier's College, Kolkata](http://www.sxccal.edu/departments/BScStatistics/BScStatistics.htm).

Prior to joining USC, I have served as a quantitative modeler at [FICO](http://www.fico.com) and [Evalueserve](http://www.evalueserve.com) where I have developed statistical models for credit scoring and for estimating banking regulatory capital pertaining to Credit and Operational risk events. 

__Research Interests__: Empirical Bayes methods, Sparse estimation theory, Joint modeling of Longitudinal and Time-to-Event data, Computational Statistics

### Publications / Articles in review
__Theory and Methods__

   Banerjee T, Mukherjee G and Sun W. _(under review)_

- [Feature Screening in Large Scale Cluster Analysis.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmva.2017.08.001)                    
   Banerjee T, Mukherjee G and Radchenko P.                                 
   _Journal of Multivariate Analysis (2017), Volume 161, Pages 191-212_ 

__Application__

- [Mass Cytometric Analysis of HIV Entry, Replication, and Remodeling in Tissue CD4+ T Cells.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28746881) 
With Nadia Roan ([UCSF Roan lab](https://roanlab.ucsf.edu/)). _Cell Reports (2017), Volume 20, Issue 4, 984 - 998_

### Software and Datasets

- [fusionclust](https://github.com/trambakbanerjee/fusionclust#fusionclust) - An R package for clustering and feature screening in large scale problems. In particular, fusionclust provides the [Big Merge Tracker (BMT)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rssb.12226/abstract) and [COSCI](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047259X17300271) algorithms for convex clustering and feature screening using an ℓ1 fusion penalty.

- [asus](https://github.com/trambakbanerjee/asus#asus) - An R package that implements the [ASUS (Adpative SURE thresholding with Side Information) procedure](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~wenguans/Papers/ASUS.pdf) for estimating a high-dimensional sparse parameter when along with the primary data we can also gather side information from secondary data sources.

- High-dimensional datasets - An excellent collection of some high-dimensional genomic datasets at [John Ramey's github page](https://github.com/ramhiser/datamicroarray#datamicroarray). Also, please look at [Brad Effron's page](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~ckirby/brad/LSI/datasets-and-programs/datasets.html).

### Teaching
I am not teaching any courses this semester. When I do, the class notes and lecture slides will be available from their respective course-homes in [blackboard](https://blackboard.usc.edu) - USC’s e-learning platform.
