I am an Economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. I completed my PhD in Economics from the University of California at Irivne in June 2019. My research interests span the union of two fields - Econometrics and Financial Economics and involve the development of Econometric methods that address research questions pertaining to banking and financial stability. 

In my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nxJe7RI9TxIAs7UxJjmDuNqgMk2Pto1u" target="_blank">current research</a> , I assess the responses of U.S. regulators in the banking and Savings and Loans (S&L) industries to widespread failures by comparing observed responses with benchmarks from theoretical models of optimal failure resolution.      

I was a dissertation intern at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during June-September 2018 and a recipient of the Graduate Dean's Dissertation Fellowship in UCI over Summer and Fall 2018. 

I have worked as a quantitative risk modeler and team manager in financial services prior to commencing my doctoral studies at UC Irvine. My research is informed by my insights from evaluating bank portfolios and experience in developing statistical models to manage credit and operational risk over the period spanning the Great Recession.

__Research Interests__: Econometrics, Financial Economics, Computational Statistics and Macroeconomics

How can the public assess the performance of regulators who administer the resolution of troubled banks? Economic theory indicates that regulators best serve the public interest when they act to discourage moral hazard and preserve channels of financial intermediation. I study the resolution of failed financial institutions in the US over the period 1984-1992, characterized by concurrent crises in the banking and Savings and Loans(S&L) industries. I determine whether regulators in the two industries conformed to norms of optimality by developing a Bayesian estimation algorithm to uncover their decision rules. The results show that the banking regulator provided assistance and carried out liquidations with higher probability when failures occurred amid adverse and benign local economic conditions respectively. Whereas the former's actions align with theoretical recommendations, the S&L regulator did not distinguish across failures based on underlying economic characteristics.  These findings provide insights into the differences in responses that contributed to the resilience of the banking regulator through the crisis and the eventual insolvency of the S&L regulator. The estimation approach developed here addresses unobserved heterogeneity, allows straightforward inference on quantities of interest and offers a coherent framework for model comparison.

This paper examines the moral hazard effects of lax regulatory and resolution standards on thrift institutions during the Savings and Loans crisis. I make use of the natural policy experiment arising from the closure of the Federal Savings and Loans Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) in 1989 and the ensuing regime of stringent regulation of thrift institutions. The paper develops a Bayesian method for causal inference by incorporating the difference-in-difference strategy into the potential outcome framework. I find that thrifts facing a high probability of failure increase their composition of safe assets and reduce the share of high-risk loans on their balance sheets relative to thrifts at a low probability of failure following the policy change. These results provide evidence of moral hazard incentives in the thrift industry prior to the introduction of enhanced regulation and oversight in 1989. The shift to safe assets is observed primarily among stock thrifts relative to mutual thrifts, showing evidence of risk-shifting from equity-holders of stock thrifts toward debt-holders prior to regulatory reforms.  In the light of the Orderly Liquidation Authority under the Dodd-Frank Act that signals the unavailability of public assistance to financial institutions in the event of failure, this paper demonstrates that the internalization of such signals by shareholders will be crucial for the policy to succeed in its intended aim of curbing moral hazard effects associated with the expectation of public assistance.

This paper develops an econometric method to determine the presence of household-level heterogeneity in relationships between consumer expectations, that are typically recorded as ordered responses in consumer surveys, and household demographic characteristics. This method extends the hierarchical Bayesian algorithm developed by Chen and Dunson (2003) for continuous outcomes and draws on the informational value of the presence of random coefficients, namely, as evidence in favor of heterogeneity in relationships between the outcome and explanatory variables. The algorithm selects covariates that have random coefficients associated with them by exploring the model space of all possible combinations of random coefficients. This study provides a framework for computing overall marginal effects that combine the fixed and random effects of each coefficient using output from the estimation algorithm. The application of this method on data from the Survey of Consumer Expectations shows that for the same change in income category and health status, households adjust their expectation of financial position and credit access differently. These findings demonstrate the intrinsic heterogeneity in household-level models for forming expectations and support the increasing focus on incorporating heterogeneity of expectations within macroeconomic models.  


**Suspension of Payments and their Consequences** with Christoffer Koch, Qian Chen and Gary Richardson

Governors suspended payments by healthy financial institutions in their states four times in the last forty years. Suspensions in Nebraska (1983), Ohio (1985), and Maryland (1985), which occurred during economic expansions, had little measurable impact at the state-level. The suspension in Rhode Island (1991), which occurred during a recession, lengthened and deepened the contraction relative to states with comparable pre-suspension patterns of economic activity. We document the suspensionâ€™s impact on macroeconomics aggregates, such as unemployment, payrolls, per capita incomes, business formation, bankruptcies, and mortgage defaults, using methods of synthetic control. Our estimates help us to address two policy questions. Were the costs of direct federal and state expenditures to prevent suspension of payments from the Great Depression until today worth the benefits? Was the cost of federal interventions to prevent suspensions of payments by commercial banks following the collapse of Lehman brothers in September 2008 worth the likely benefits? In both cases, our answer is yes.
