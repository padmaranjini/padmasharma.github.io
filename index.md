I am a fourth year PhD candidate in Economics at University of California at Irvine with specializations in Econometrics and Banking. In my current research, I study bank failures during the Savings and Loans crisis and their resolution by the FDIC using a novel Bayesian latent class model and uncover heterogeneity in how systemic and idiosyncratic failures were addressed.

I have received my undergraduate degree in Economics, Mathematics and Statistics from Bangalore University where I was awarded the Gold Medal in Mathematics. I hold a Masters degree in Economics from Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research (established by the Reserve Bank of India) and was awarded the RBI Governor's Gold Medal. 

I have worked as a quantitative modeler and team manager in financial services in India, the UK, Chile and  the US prior to commencing my doctoral studies at UC Irvine. I developed statistical models to calculate banking regulatory capital over the period spanning the Great Recession and use my experiences from the crisis to inform my research.

__Research Interests__: Banking crises, Bayesian Nonparametrics, Latent class models, MCMC estimation

### Working Papers
__Theory and Methods__

- Bayesian Latent Class Modeling with Ordinal Response Data

Bayesian methods to estimate latent class models have been developed and implemented in contexts involving continuous 
and binary outcome data but have not yet been adapted to model ordinal responses. I address this open area of research 
and develop an efficient collapsed Gibbs sampler to estimate such models in univariate and multivariate settings. 
I discuss issues pertaining to identification, prior sensitivity and identify constraints on the data that ensure that the posterior 
means are centered around the true parameter values.

### Software and Datasets

- [fusionclust](https://github.com/trambakbanerjee/fusionclust#fusionclust) - An R package for clustering and feature screening in large scale problems. In particular, fusionclust provides the [Big Merge Tracker (BMT)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rssb.12226/abstract) and [COSCI](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047259X17300271) algorithms for convex clustering and feature screening using an ℓ1 fusion penalty.

- [asus](https://github.com/trambakbanerjee/asus#asus) - An R package that implements the [ASUS (Adpative SURE thresholding with Side Information) procedure](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~wenguans/Papers/ASUS.pdf) for estimating a high-dimensional sparse parameter when along with the primary data we can also gather side information from secondary data sources.

- High-dimensional datasets - An excellent collection of some high-dimensional genomic datasets at [John Ramey's github page](https://github.com/ramhiser/datamicroarray#datamicroarray). Also, please look at [Brad Effron's page](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~ckirby/brad/LSI/datasets-and-programs/datasets.html).

### Teaching
I am not teaching any courses this semester. When I do, the class notes and lecture slides will be available from their respective course-homes in [blackboard](https://blackboard.usc.edu) - USC’s e-learning platform.
