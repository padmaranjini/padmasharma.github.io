## About me

I am a third year PhD candidate in [Statistics](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/StatGroup/) co-advised by Prof. [Gourab Mukherjee](https://gmukherjee.github.io/) and Prof. [Wenguang Sun](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~wenguans/) in the department of [Data Sciences and Operations](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations) at [USC Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/).

Prior to joining USC, I have served as a quantitative modeler at [FICO](http://www.fico.com) and [Evalueserve](http://www.evalueserve.com) where I have developed statistical models for credit scoring and for estimating banking regulatory capital pertaining to Credit and Operational risk events.
